## How to Play

### Game Flow

1. **Night Phase**:
   - Werewolves choose a player to eliminate
   - Doctor chooses a player to protect
   - Seer investigates a player's role

2. **Day Phase**:
   - Players debate and discuss suspicions
   - Deception detection analyzes statements
   - Players vote to exile someone
   - Winner is determined

### Player Roles

- **Villager**: Basic role, tries to identify werewolves
- **Werewolf**: Tries to eliminate villagers without being caught
- **Seer**: Can investigate one player per night to learn their role
- **Doctor**: Can protect one player per night from elimination

## 🔍 Deception Detection

The game includes a sophisticated deception detection system that:

- **Self-Analysis**: Players analyze their own statements for deceptive intent
- **Peer Analysis**: Other players analyze each statement for deception
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains deception history for each player
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for deception assessments

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Number of players
- Role distribution
- Game parameters
- Debug settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Rate Limits (429 Error)**
   - **Cause**: Free tier Gemini API has rate limits
   - **Solution**: Wait a few minutes or upgrade to paid tier
   - **Workaround**: Use `--model gemini-pro` for different rate limits

2. **Missing API Key**
   - **Solution**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable
   - **Alternative**: Use embedded test key (limited functionality)

3. **Import Errors**
   - **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Check**: Verify Python version is 3.8+

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `config.py`:
```python
"debug_mode": True
```
